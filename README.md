## Hiiii ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hieu
I am a passionate software developer. I love to work on everything that is software related. However, my expertise seems to be back-end development!
I am currently a Sophomore at DePauw University! There, I have placed myself top 30 in Mid-West ICPC (Competitive Programming).
I'm always eager to learn more about information technology. I'm also willing to volunteer in the respective field if possible.

Thank you!
